# Denoising images with Denoising Autoencoder
This repository consists of denoising images using Autoencoder, the autoencoder model was trained using the **Fashion MNIST** dataset, in This repo you can find a notebook named **Denoising Autoencoder.ipynb** which Denoise images of size (28,28) after adding a random normal distribution noise to them, the same notebook can be found on Google Colab by clicking on this [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/IhabTALEB/Denoising-images-with-Denoising-Autoencoders/blob/master/Denoising%20Autoencoder.ipynb). Denoised samples are in the following picture.
